As can be seen from the figures above, afternoon is the most active time for the users to post questions and answers in the USA time zone. Also, 9 and 10 am in the morning, the afternoon time for some part of Asia and Europe also shows some rise in user activity. Geographical analysis of the website suggests that most of the registered users are from USA and then from Europe.

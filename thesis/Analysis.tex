\chapter{Purposive Social Network Analysis} \label{Chapter:Purposive Social Network Analysis}

Data is collected from StackOverflow and Reddit website and itÕs cleaned, processed and structured into RDF. The data is also analyzed to get more information about the social network, communication ties, user behaviour, etc. The system also annotates the data with keywords, links it to the linked data cloud, searches for answers of the unanswered question and recommends experts. This is also analyzed and discussed in details. This chapter analyses how the system benefits and solves the problem of current PSN.


\section{StackOverflow Analysis}

StackOverflow website is well structured and provides lots of information about the questions, answers and users. The data collected from the website is easier to analyze compared to Reddit website.

  \caption{StackOverflow at glance as of June 2012}
  \label{Table:tabex}
\end{table}

As of June 2014, there are over one million registered users in StackOverflow and more than 3.2 millions questions asked by users. The questions are categorized using tags and individual users can subscribe to tags to receive daily, weekly or monthly email of all the question asked in the tag. There are more than 30 thousand tags associated with various questions and answers. Users have casted more than 26 million votes to mark the good questions and answers.


\subsection{Question and Answers}

[figure: Questions and answers posted per month on StackOverflow]The figure above shows the number of questions asked and answered by users each month from the year 2009 to 2014. The trend shows the popularity of the website and itÕs increase user growth. On average there are [x] number of questions and [x] answers posted each week and each question has [x] number of answers on average.[Questions posted by the day of week]
The analysis of posts shows that the programmers prefer to ask the questions and answers on weekdays as they are working on weekdays and find the problems in their program and post it on the website. Most questions are posted on Wednesday (?) and most answers are posted on Friday (?).Only looking at the answered questions, itÕs seen that on average a question receives 2.006 answers and .12\% of questions receives more than 15 answers. So, the good questions do get good response from the community.The analysis of the unanswered question shows that despite high user feedback and participation (45\%) of the question in StackOverflow website has no accepted answers and (20\%) of the questions has no answer at all. These questions are either repeated questions or are too vague in description. When the question is not specific then the moderators flag it and users ignore the question.

\subsection{Users}

Users who contribute to the website are the main actors of this purposive social network. There are more than 1.2 million registered users in StackOverflow and they ask the questions, answer it, vote it and moderate the community. The users are not directly linked to each other to create relationships; in this network the relationship is formed by their interaction and their contribution. The user behaviour, their motivation to use the website and incentive to contribute is described below.[fig: User reputation histogram]Despite the high content generation by the users, 56.02\% do not interact or contribute to the website, they have 1 reputation point that they receive while joining the website. The other problem is that new users are not familiar with the website etiquette and do not follow the community rules and it causes their questions to be ignored. When the userÕs activity is analyzed, itÕs seen that (18\%) of the users on the website asked only 1 question and never came back to the website and this percentage is even higher in the unanswered question. (45\%) of the unanswered question is made by the first time users and they didnÕt get any response so the user never came back.


\subsection{Tags}

The questions are answers are provided with tags to categorize and arrange for easy search and discovery. The entire website is categorized using the tags and the list of most popular tags are shown in the table. The figure shows the weekly use of the popular tags. The number of questions asked for each tags also provides an insight on the popular language used by developers at the time.Tags	No. of questionsC#	Java	PHP	JavaScript	Android	Table: Five most popular tags and its instances[fig: Tag trends per week of most popular tags]The analysis of questions shows that each question has between one to five tags associated with it. Most questions (70.30\%) have 2 to 4 tags associated with it. The relationship between the tags shows the overlapping of networks and how it is tied with one another discussed in details in the next section.The other problem noticed in the unanswered question is that they are not properly tagged. A quick analysis of the unanswered question tags shows that (54\%) of the unanswered question have 1 or 2 tags. The difference in tagging of the question could also cause in not getting an answer to the questions. The more tag a question has the more community of people can view the question so the chances of it getting an answer increases. Also, the more specific tag a question has, the more specific experts can view the question and can give a detailed and higher quality answer. The new user makes this mistake and lose out on a quality users and experts audience. The details of the relation on number of tags and how it differs in answer and unanswered question can be seen in the table below.Number of Tags	Answered question (%)	Unanswered question (%)1		2		3		4		5		>5		The above table shows the problem with relation of number of tags and how it affects answering a question. This doesnÕt explains the problem if the question has wrong tags. So it reached the wrong community of users and it was ignored because it wasnÕt in their area of expertise.During the initial analysis of the data, it was attempted to figure out if users used wrong tags for their question. There was no accurate way to answer this question. A simpler solution was used to figure out this problem. First, a quick comparison was done to find the number of unanswered question from big and general tags like Java, Python, etc. with the specific versions of the tags like Java EE, Python 3.1, etc.The analysis showed that the percentage of unanswered question was lower in the specific tags than the general tags for 1000 questions. See the table below for detailed description of top 3 tags and itÕs specialized tags.General Tag unanswered question	Specialized tag Unanswered questionJava Ð 37%	Java 1 Ð 18%Java 2 Ð Java 3 ÐC++ - 	C++ 1 ÐC++ 2 ÐC++ 3 ÐPython - 	Python 1 ÐPython 2 ÐPython3 ÐThis doesnÕt really provide a concrete answer to the question as correlation doesnÕt mean causation but it does give some insight into the problem. The problem could be that the general tags get a lot more question each day so the questions can get easily buried deep and couldnÕt reach the right people. The paper[] shows that is these forums most users usually read the top page and the view count has a steep decline as we go further into the next pages.The other problem could be that the big communities are heavily moderated and if the moderator sees any problem with the post, they quickly remove it. Also, these pages have a lot more moderator and each moderator have to stick by the community rules but they have their own views as well. The analysis shows that the percentage of removed questions by moderators is higher in the general tags (5\%) than in the smaller tags (2.9\%). Another view is that the users who answer the questions on general tags page find the best question suited for them in the big heap of questions, they donÕt see the incentive to look through each question and try to answer as much as possible because of limited time.


\subsection{Votes and Reputation}

The other reason more questions remained unanswered in popular tags is because users can get more votes by answering questions in the bigger tags then the smaller tags. The analysis of votes shows that in the table below. Here general tag is considered top 10 tags with more than 100k subscribers and specialized tags are the smaller tags of the top 10 general tags with less than 20k subscribers. More details can be found in appendix.Votes for answers	General Tags	Specialized Tags0		1		>1 - <=3		> 3 - <=5		<5 - <=10		>10		<0		This analysis doesnÕt confirm the quality of the answers, just the votes. It canÕt be said that the quality of answers are better in bigger tags then in smaller tags. It could be just because of the number of users in each tag and how many of them vote for the questions and answers. UsersÕ behaviour changes based on the size of the community [cite paper]. The other interesting thing noticed in the analysis was the relation between userÕs reputation and the answers and votes the post got. It had the positive correlation. More reputation points a user had, it increased the chances of the question getting answered. It could be because of how long the user had been the website, so it accumulated more reputation points. (23\%) of the unanswered questionsÕ user had no reputation points.

\subsection{Keyword annotation and categories}

The previous analysis is done on the data collected from the StackOverflow website. This section gives an overview of the added annotation to the questions and answers by the system.The system annotated the question and answers from the DBpedia and OpenCalis websites. The annotation procedure adds keywords to the keywords table with the degree of confidence. The advantage of adding keywords is that in StackOverflow website users are restricted to the already existing list of keywords and then need certain reputation points to add a brand new keyword. No such restriction existed in the PSN system. Also, the system annotated all the occurrence of a keyword thus giving it higher degree of confidence. If a keyword occurred multiple times in a question and answer then it was one of the important keywords to describe the post. The analysis of keyword annotation shows that the system added [x] keywords to the posts and [x] were unique keywords i.e. these unique keywords were repeated multiple times within the question and answers. On average [x] keywords were added to each post.To maintain the quality of the keywords, the degree of confidence was kept at 75\%, any keyword with lower rating was ignored by the system. This reduced the number of overall added keywords. In the beginning when the confidence rating was kept at 50\%, the analysis of 1000 posts showed that the average number of keywords was [] keywords per post but it also annotated the not technical texts. Then the value of degree of confidence was increased and the keyword category was limited to the technical terms.The keywords were also categorized using the DBpedia categories. Every keyword had a list of categories it associated with and the list was separate from the keywords. The dataset had [x] number of categories in total and each keyword had [x] categories in average. The categories didnÕt have a degree of confidence level because the list was directly taken from the DBpedia website.

\subsection{Answers and Experts}

The PSN system searches for answers for the unanswered questions in the database and gives each answer a confidence rating between 0 and 1. The system was tested using all the unanswered question from the month of July 2014, it had [x] number of unanswered questions and the system search for relevant answers with confidence rating more than 75\% for [x] questions. [x]\% of unanswered questions had one or more question with confidence rating of 85\% and [x]\% of unanswered question has confidence rating of more than 50%.Answers with confidence rating	Number of questions>90%	80-90%	70-80%	60-70%	50-60%	Table showing answers to question ratioIn the search result any answer with rating less than 50\% is rejected and only top 3 answers are shown.  The table above shows all the answers (without the limit of 3) available for each range of confidence rating for the unanswered questions. For the evaluation of answers the algorithm was changed to show the lower rating answers and the number of questions with one or more answer changed to staggering [x]%.The search result also showed the list of experts recommended to answer each unanswered question. The list followed the same pattern as answer. It only showed top 3 experts with confidence rating higher than 50\%. If the question didnÕt have any answer with confidence rating greater than 50\% even then the system would show a list of recommended experts. This list was also restricted to the experts with confidence rating of greater than 50%.Experts with confidence rating	No. of questions>90%	80%-90%	70%-80%	60%-70%	50%-60%	There are [] questions with at least one recommended expert, thatÕs [x]\% of unanswered question.


\section{Reddit Analysis}

The structure of Reddit website is completely different from StackOverflow, hence the same analysis could not be done with the Reddit dataset. First, the posts do not have any tags, so they couldnÕt appear to multiple communities of users. The posts are posted in a particular subreddit and they couldnÕt be shared across different subreddits. To do so, user had to create a brand new post with the same question on a different subreddit.Also, Reddit posts are threaded, a parent comment has multiple child comments and users mostly deflect from the main topic and start discussion on a different topic, this sometimes is also personal. This is completely different from StackOverflow because users use answer posts for answers and any other conversation they want to have is strictly restricted to comments section. This caused a major problem with Reddit dataset, as it couldnÕt be decided which comment or the child comment is the actual answer to the question. Further on, unlike StackOverflow, there is no ÔAccepted AnswerÕ tag for Reddit posts. So, it was quite hard to understand if the question got a valid answer or not.Post type	NumberPosts	Comments	Registered Users	Votes	Table: General overview of Reddit datasetThe analysis of 15 different technical subreddits, 200 thousand questions and 2.3 million comments is done quite differently and separately from StackOverflow datasets. A post has [x] comments and [x] votes on average. A comment, however, has [x] average vote and [x] child comment.Here, if any post has no comments with positive vote or no comments at all, then it is considered as unanswered question. Any post that has at least one positive comment, then it is assumed that it answers the question. This is not a best strategy as it has lots of uncertainty but no other way had been found to solve the problem. Only one subreddit Ô/r/learnprogrammingÕ has an ÔSolvedÕ flair that gives a confirmation that the question has been answered.The posts on these subreddits are not only questions but also discussion posts and news posts where users are sharing inks to other websites and blogs. There are no ways to distinguish between these types of posts. So for the analysis, any post that is linked to the external source was considered a discussion posts or news posts. In the big subreddits like /r/java, /r/python, (78\%) of the posts are discussion and news posts. They are linked with an external website. Also, (2\%) are the cross post, these posts are Reddit post linked from another subreddit. The number of discussion and news posts drop significantly in the Ôlearn programmingÕ subreddits. Only (12.4\%) of posts are linked post, (4.6\%) are cross posts and the rest are question posts.There are no tags on the subreddit posts, so the name of the subreddit is added as a tag to the post. Sometimes in the general subreddit like /r/learnprogramming users add name of the programming language in the square brackets, e.g. [python]. These names are also added as tags to the posts.Using all the generated data and using the subset that includes question data, the dataset has been analyzed. (23\%) of posts have no comments at all and it is assumed as unanswered questions. (57\%) of these unanswered question have 0 or negative votes that is why users have ignored them.The percentage of unanswered questions created by a new user with no votes is (39\%). It is much more easier to create a new account in Reddit as it doesnÕt require an email address, only a username and password. So it is assumed users create a new account just to ask a question and never use it again.There are very few (3.8\%) unanswered question that has more than 5 votes but no comments at all. So it is assumed that if the question is interesting, the users engage in some kind of discussion. The majority of answered posts (78\%) have more than one comment. The table below gives a general overview of all the analysis done.No of question post	No of discussion post	No. of post with ÔSolvedÕ flair	No of parent comments	No of child comments	No of posts with 0 votes	No of posts with Ðve votes	No of posts with >5 votes	Unanswered questions	Since the Reddit API doesnÕt allow getting more than 2000 posts for any subreddit, all the posts are not collected. So then trend and analysis is done only on extracted data. So a long term posting trend cannot be done on the Reddit data, but using a weekÕs data is clear than user posts most on Wednesday (??). [image showing posting trend][image showing histogram for a week]\subsection{Keywords annotation and categories}Just like StackOverflow data the question and comments are annotated. The system added [x] keywords to the posts and [x] were unique keywords i.e. these unique keywords were repeated multiple times within the question and answers. On average [x] keywords were added to each post. Just like before the degree of confidence id kept greater than 50%.The keywords were also categorized like StackOverflow data. The dataset had [x] number of categories in total and each keyword had [x] categories in average. The categories didnÕt have a degree of confidence level because the list was directly taken from the DBpedia website.\subsection{Answers and Experts}The same search algorithm was used to search for unanswered questions in Reddit from the month of June 2014. There were [x] number of unanswered question and [x]\% had one or more answers with degree of confidence more than 50\% and [x]\\% has answer with confidence rating more than 85%.A quick glance at the results showed that most of the answers [x]% came from StackOverflow website. Answers with confidence rating	Number of questions>90%	80-90%	70-80%	60-70%	50-60%	Table showing answers to question ratioThe same pattern of top 3 answers is maintained in this search result too but when the limit of confidence rating is removed, [x]\% of unanswered questions has one or more answers.Again, similar to StackOverflow, 3 experts are recommended to each question. [x]\% of questions has one or more recommend expert. The table below gives a list of percentage of question and list of recommended experts.Experts with confidence rating	No. of questions>90%	80%-90%	70%-80%	60%-70%	50%-60%	One thing was noticed in all the search result and expert recommendation of Reddit website it that most of the answers and experts were recommended from StackOverflow website. The reason behind this could be that the StackOverflow website data is huge compared to Reddit dataset (See table a and b). So the users in StackOverflow website has more keywords and reputation point associated with them. Similarly, the answers are affected too.Also, since the StackOverflow and Reddit database was combined when it was converted to RDF, so it wasnÕt possible to test the quality of Reddit answers and userÕs expertise by completely disabling the StackOverflow data and checking for quality of answers and experts.

\section {Network Linkage and Social Ties}

StackOverflow is not a typical social networking website per se as users cannot create explicit friendship or follow other peoples' work, they cannot send private messages or form groups. Reddit on the other hand allows user to make friends and send private messages but these information are not public and cannot be downloaded by API without userÕs explicit consent.The social ties are formed implicitly by users interacting with each other by asking questions and answering them, voting on the posts and commenting on them. The communication network is studied to see the social ties of the individuals [monge2003theories].\subsection{Communication network structure}For the network analysis of StackOverflow and Reddit dataset, the communications between users are studied. Here, the users who ask questions, give answers, create posts and comments are nodes and edges are formed between the users who interact with them. The relationship between users becomes stronger the more they interact with each other.[image to show s/n graph S/O]The image above shows the sparse and interconnected communication network build over time. There are [x] nodes and [x] ties between the nodes. The nodes on the edge of the graph only asked or answered one question and never interacted with any other users. There are [x] number of single connected nodes. The users in the middle are heavily connected to a lot of other people. They are the expert users who answer a lot of post and are center to the network. There are also expert users who connect one network with another, they have knowledge of different programming languages and connect two or more communities together.In the network analysis, the edges gets stronger the more users interact with each other but the close analysis of the network graph shows that the edges are quite weak between the nodes. Only few nodes have medium strength nodes. [image to show s/n graph Reddit]Similar things can be observed by studying the communication network of Reddit. There are [x] nodes and [x] edges in the graph and [x] nodes are in the edge of the graph with only single connection. The nodes in the center are connected to multiple nodes and acts as bridges between different communities. Also, [x, y, z] nodes are the moderators of the subreddit, so they post more than normal users. The only thing different here is that the edges are thicker in Reddit community than StackOverflow. This could be because Reddit has a relaxed commenting rule where users can have informal discussions. StackOverflow on the other hand has strict community guidelines where users can only interact in comments of the question or answers.Homopholy network \subsection{Tags network}The other way to observe the community structure is to study how the tags are interconnected with each other. The questions have multiple tags attached to each other and these questions appear in all the different tags page and people subscribed to each tags can view and answer the questions. This makes the communities overlap with each other and shows the strength of relationship between the communities.[image for tag relationship S/O]The image above shows the relationships between the most popular tags and how closely they are related to each other. In the following graph each segment size is directly proportional to the number of instance it is used and the connection between the tags indicate the times they have been used together in a question. The thickness of the connection shows the strength of the relations. The segment is colour coded by the frequency of connections, red segments are strongly connected and blue segments are weakly connected.[image of popular tags clustered together]The clustering of the tags shows the relationship between the tags and technologies. The two popular tags JAVA and Android are closely related to each other but are scarcely joined with other tags. The strongest relationship is between jQuery and JavaScript because the overlapping framework of the two programming languages. C, C++ and C\# are also a closely related groups as well as iOS, Objective-C and iPhone. However, sometimes Objective-C is also tagged with C, C++ and C\#, if by mistake or deliberately can be argued.There is a large cluster of connected web development languages, CSS, HTML, JavaScript and jQuery, indicating the close knit use of these technologies in development of website and web applications. The interesting thing is the relationship between the scripting langue PHP and Python, they are popular tags but are sparsely connected with other tags and are weakly linked with database related tags.Since, Reddit donÕt have tags, the cross posts are inspected to find the relationship between the subreddits. There were only [x] cross posts in the dataset, so the relationship between the subreddits is not as strong as StackOverflow but it follows the similar pattern.[image with Reddit x-post]Looking at the userÕs interaction also showed the user behaviour in subscribing to a tag or subreddit. Tag/Subreddit	Subscribed User	Active userJava		PHP				\section{Incentive Design and Quality Control}

StackOverflow is one of the most popular question and answering website for software developers. Reddit is one of the popular website for people to share web links with people and itÕs also popular with programmers but not as much as StackOverflow. The overall rank of Reddit is [x] and StackOverflow is [x].These website have a strong incentive design to motivate people to contribute and grow the community. Also, they maintain high quality content by crowdsourcing that leads to the popularity of the website. Detailed analysis of these features are done below.

\subsection{Incentive Design}

\subsubsection{StackOverflow}StackOverflow website uses a game theoretic model to encourage user participation and activity. Participation is encouraged through an elaborate point system and users also receive badges for participation. Also, the top contributor and user with highest reputation are featured on the question page, giving the user more visibility and acknowledgement of the userÕs expertise. This encourages participants to accumulate more points and contribute to get recognition.When an answer is voted up, the user gains 10 reputations and 5 points when the question is voted up. When an answer is accepted the user receives 15 points and there is also negative point system, a user looses 2 reputation point when a question or an answer is voted down. This keeps the spamming in check and repeated questions and answers are avoided.Reputation point	No. of users1	2-10	11-1001	101-1000			<0	Table to show how many users have reputationAs the table shows, there are 669554 users with 1 reputation point and one user with 452951 reputation points. The distribution of the users reputation shows that more than half of the users are lurkers and the elite users with the most reputation points are the editors and moderators of the community and are considered the expert in their field.The reputation of the user has a direct correlation with the trust in the community. StackOverflow has designed an excellent reward program to motivate and incentivize the users to contribute and gain more reputations and badges.The system also encourages users to participate as the higher reputation points gain more privileges. When a user has 15 reputation points, only then they can up vote and 50 points allows users to comment. To stop harassment and spam, user requires 125 reputation points to vote down and it costs the user 1 reputation point. The incentive model is thorough and higher reputation points open more gates for users to interact and contribute and be acknowledged as the expert in their field.Currently, there are 77 different types of badges given to the user based on their contribution. There are badges given to the user who asks questions with 1 reputation point (Student), to the user who edits the answers to make posts better (Editor) and to even an active user for a year (Yearling). This type of virtual acknowledgement of efforts encourage the user to participate and contribute to the website.The other method that encourages the users to participate is the promptness of the response. The asker prefers to receive information sooner rather than later, and will stop the process when satisfied with the cumulative value of the posted information. The analysis of the posts shows that half of the questions get an answer within an hour of the posting and within a day the questions receives an accepted answer. When the answers are delayed, the questioners look for alternative websites to get a response.[image Time to receive the first answer][image Time to get the accepted answer]\subsubsection{Reddit}Reddit follows the same model, here the reputation points are called ÔkarmaÕ and a user can have link karma from creating posts and comment karma by making comments. The karma is the accumulation of all the up votes and down votes. But the link karma and comment karma are not added together. Higher the karma points, more popular their posts are and Reddit algorithm puts their post at the top of the page.Karma value	No. of users with link karma	No. of users with comment karma1		2-10		11-1001		101-1000						<0		Table to show how many users have karmaAs table shows, there are 669554 users with 1 karma and one user with 452951 karma. The distribution of the users reputation shows that more than half of the users are lurkers and the elite users with the most link and comment karma are the editors and moderators of the community and are considered the expert in their field. Also, there are more users with comment karma then the link karma.Similar to StackOverflow badges, Reddit has an award system when a user can earn different awards based on their contribution and it is visible in their trophy case. Currently, Reddit offers 34 awards, they can be as simple as ÔVerified Email AddressÕ given to users who verify their email address to ÔBest LinkÕ or ÔBest CommentÕ when they contribute positively to the community.Another good incentive model Reddit use is the award of ÔReddit GoldÕ. Sometimes users use this as an actual award to an excellent response or offer as reward for certain type of contribution. Gold is rewarded by one user to another and it provides special privileges to the Gold winner. They get ad free and custom experience of the website and get access to a special ÔGoldÕ subreddits.This kind of reward system helps get user prompt response and get good quality contribution. The analysis of the posts shows that half of the posts get a comment within an hour of the posting.[image Time to receive the first comment]

\subsection{Quality Control}The community thrives because of the high quality of content and it is possible by the userÕs action and moderation. Users vote up the good questions and answers and vote down the bad quality content or repeated posts. There are more than 6 million votes casted in StackOverflow and the user with enough reputations are allowed to cast 40 votes per day. Reddit doesnÕt have any limit in casting votes, there are total [x] votes in the collected dataset.[Reddit and S/O QuestionVote count histogram]Vote	S/O Question vote count	S/O Question Vote count0		1-10		11-100		101-1000						<0		Table showing questions and vote countThe analysis of StackOverflow questions and votes shows that every question receives 3.06 votes on average. One question received negative 115 votes and the highest vote received to a question is 2499. Similar analysis of answers and their votes shows that, on average an answer receives 0.99 votes and the lowest vote to an answer is negative 57 and the highest vote is 4432.[Reddit and S/O Vote count histogram]Reddit analysis shows that every question receives [x] votes on average. One question received negative [x] votes and the highest vote received to a question is 2499. Similar analysis of comments and their votes shows that, on average a comment receives [x] votes and the lowest vote to a comment is negative [x] and the highest vote is [x].Vote	Reddit Post vote count	Reddit comment Vote count0		1-10		11-100		101-1000						<0		\subsubsection{Community Moderation}Another way the quality of the community is maintained is through moderation. The community members elect moderators and they are considered expert in the field. They and given responsibility to edit and remove the posts. They keep the spamming in check and maintain the quality of the posts in the community. They also have the authority to ban users if they are found misbehaving and spamming.StackOverflow and Reddit provide additional badges for moderatos. They also have extra privileges than the normal user and have sometimes access to the community interactions and extra information. Average number of moderators in the popular StackOverflow tags are [x] and in general are [x]. They moderate (edit and remove) [x] posts daily on average. In Reddit, average number of moderators in a subreddit are [x] and no data is freely available about their moderation activity in the community.		
\section{Expert Recommendation}

The PSN system used the reputation and karma points to search experts based on the keywords and recommend them as experts for the unanswered questions. The system only picks users that have answered any questions and have at least one positive vote for the answer. StackOverflow and Reddit users are merged together in the expert database so they canÕt be analyzed separately. There are [x] number of experts in the database and [x] number of keywords. They are recommended based on individual keywords and also set of keywords taken together. The keywords also have categories, so the experts can also be recommended based on categories. The recommendation algorithm not only picks the top expert for each keyword, it also picks them based on set of keywords and categories.For example, according to the StackOverflow website the top user or an expert of C\# is Jon Skeet with more than eighty thousand reputation points and Python is Alex Martelli with more than nineteen thousand reputation point. These users appear on the individual pages of the tags as the top users and without the tag disambiguation they only appear as an expert on a particulate tag, not the joint concept of the topic.Language	Top User with reputation pointC#	Java	Python	PHP	Javascript	When the tags are disambiguated and the keywords are matched to the topics, both Java and C\# is categorized at the Object Oriented programming language and here Jon Skeet is considered as an expert in the whole area with more than one hundred and twenty thousand reputation points. Similarly, when the programming languages are further categorized as server side script ion language with Python, PHP and Perl as main languages, Alex Martelli is considered as an expert and the user CMS is expert in the client side languages such as Java and AJAX with twelve thousand reputation points.Language	Top User with reputation pointObject Oriented Language (Java, C#)	Java	Python	PHP	Javascript	This becomes more complicated when the set of tags are considered. For example, when Java and MySQL are used together then the top expert is [x] with [x] reputation point. ItÕs none of the original experts. Again, when another set if used Java, MySQL, Database and Lucene, then [x] is considered the expert with [x] reputation points.The system provides more flexibility and diversity in generating the expert lists that is not originally present in the main websites. It also provides experts across the domain without any restriction of website and can help in better search and discovery of experts and information.

\section{Linked Data Graph}

StackOverflow and Reddit data are annotated, converted intro triples and linked with DBpedia and Drupal Datasets. DBpedia Spotlight and OpenCalis applications are used to annotate and link it to the Linked Data cloud.There are [x] million triples that contains all the information about the posts and users. [x] million of them are the annotated keywords that are linked to the DBpedia dataset and [x] are linked to Drupal dataset.User data is converted using FOAF ontology and there are [x] FOAF profiles exist in the dataset.[image of n-triple]

\section{Discourse Analysis}

All the statistical analysis done of the StackOverflow and Reddit data are done by analyzing the data using various tools. A discourse analysis was also done by looking through the data to find interesting posts and general trend that is not properly addressed by tools.Looking through the questions and answers itÕs quite clear that StackOverflow interactions are much more formal and structured than the Reddit interactions. RedditÕs post are more discussion oriented and people share current news and updates. StackOverflow questions are more problem oriented questions and sometimes they are also discussions, but they occur mostly in comments and chats.On average, StackOverflow questions and answers are longer than RedditÕs questions and comments. Also, Reddit posts get more votes than StackOverflow posts. A quick analysis of one thousand posts from each website also shows that there are more spelling errors in Reddit posts than StackOverflow posts.The posts and comments on Reddit are more personal. Users ask more indirect questions like asking for recommendation for books, tools, etc. User also shares lots of memes and funny posts that are not clearly related to the programming language. UserÕs also share personal stories, anecdotes and experience.[image example of reddit personal posts]However, in StackOverflow, most of the posts are about solving technical problems but there are few posts where people share jokes, humorous anecdotes and trivia. There was a question asking users to share jokes that have [x] answers and one where users are sharing their favourite cartoons that has [x] responses.[image showing snippet of s/o funny posts].There are some questions that have funny and controversial answers too. A question from a user about XHTML gave the humorus response showing importance of space.[image of the answer]There are controversial questions where people share their personal experience that get so many responses that moderators have to close the thread.[image s/o prog opinion]People also use this platform to share trivia about different languages and their programming experience.[image strangest language feature]Reddit also has more pop culture references in the posts and comments. [xkcd/harry potter comic]

The \fref{Figure:figex4a} shows the number of questions asked and answered by users each month. In the year 2012, each questions have on average 1.645 number of answers.

This community is made of programmers and their motivation is to solve the problem they had encountered and to provide answers to gain reputations. Thousands of questions and answers are posted everyday. The analysis of posts shows that the programmers prefer to ask the questions and answers on weekdays.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{chart1.png}
  \caption{Questions posted by the day of week}
  \label{Figure:figex4b}
\end{figure}

Despite high user feedback and participation, 23.79\% of questions are not answered or the answers do not receive any up votes. On average a question receives 2.006 answers and .12\% of questions receives more than 15 answers.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{chart2.png}
  \caption{Answer count to the questions}
  \label{Figure:figex4c}
\end{figure}

The questions are answers are provided with tags to categorize and arrange for easy search and discovery. The entire website is categorized using the tags and the list of most popular tags are shown in the table. The figure shows the weekly use of the popular tags. The number of questions asked for each tags also provides an insight on the popular language used by developers at the time.

\begin{table}[!htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Tags} & \textbf{Number of instance}\\  \midrule
   C\# & 370074 \\ \midrule
   JAVA &  315488 \\ \midrule

   JavaScript & 278592 \\ \midrule
   Android & 244791 \\

\end{figure}

The analysis of questions shows that each question has between one to five tags associated with it. Most questions (70.30\%) have 2 to 4 tags associated with it. The relationship between the tags shows the overlapping of networks and how it is tied with one another.

\cite{Eberhardt2012} provided an interactive graph in his website to show the relationships between the most popular tags and how closely they are related to each other. In the following graph each segment size is directly proportional to the number of instance it is used and the connection between the tags indicate the times they have been used together in a question. The thickness of the connection shows the strength of the relations. The segment is colour coded by the frequency of connections, red segments are strongly connected and blue segments are weakly connected.

\end{figure}

The clustering of the tags shows the relationship between the tags and technologies. The two popular tags JAVA and Android are closely related to each other but are scarcely joined with other tags. The strongest relationship is between jQuery and JavaScript because the overlapping framework of the two programming languages. C, C++ and C\# are also a closely related groups as well as iOS, Objective-C and iPhone. However, sometimes Objective-C is also tagged with C, C++ and C\#, if by mistake or deliberately can be argued.
There is a large cluster of connected web development languages, CSS, HTML, JavaScript and jQuery, indicating the close knit use of these technologies in development of website and web applications. The interesting thing is the relationship between the scripting langue PHP and Python, they are popular tags but are sparsely connected with other tags and are weakly linked with database related tags.


\section{Role of Individual Actors}

Users who contribute to the website are the main actors of this purposive social network. There are more than 1.2 million registered users in StackOverflow and they ask the questions, answer it, vote it and moderate the community. The users are not directly linked to each other to create relationships; in this network the relationship is formed by their interaction and their contribution. The user behaviour, their motivation to use the website and incentive to contribute is described below.

Despite the high content generation by the users, 56.02\% do not interact or contribute to the website, they have 1 reputation point that they receive while joining the website.

\begin{table}[!htb]

  \begin{tabular}{cc}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Reputation} & \textbf{Number of users}\\  \midrule
  1 & 669554\\ \midrule
  2-10 & 126235\\ \midrule
  11-100 & 295389\\ \midrule
  101-1000 & 3161130\\  \midrule
  1001-10000 & 170993\\ \midrule

  20001-100000 & 895\\ \midrule
  100001-200000 & 49\\ \midrule
  less than 200000 & 11\\
  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Number of users with reputations}
  \label{Table:tabex3}
\end{table}

As \tref{Table:tabex3} shows, there are 669554 users with 1 reputation point and one user with 452951 reputation points. The distribution of the users reputation shows that more than half of the users are lurkers and the elite users with the most reputation points are the editors and moderators of the community and are considered the expert in their field.

The reputation of the user has a direct correlation with the trust in the community. StackOverflow has designed an excellent reward program to motivate and incentivize the users to contribute and gain more reputations and badges.

Currently, there are 77 different types of badges given to the user based on their contribution. There are badges given to the user who asks questions with 1 reputation point (Student), to the user who edits the answers to make posts better (Editor) and to even an active user for a year (Yearling). This type of virtual acknowledgement of efforts encourage the user to participate and contribute to the website.

The other method that encourages the users to participate is the promptness of the response. The asker prefers to receive information sooner rather than later, and will stop the process when satisfied with the cumulative value of the posted information. The analysis of the posts shows that half of the questions get an answer within an hour of the posting and within a day the questions receives an accepted answer. When the answers are delayed, the questioners look for alternative websites to get a response.

\end{figure}


\section{Incentive Design}

The StackOverflow website uses a game theoretic model to encourage user participation and activity. Participation is encouraged through an elaborate point system and users also receive badges for participation. Also, the top contributor and user with highest reputation are featured on the question page, giving the user more visibility and acknowledgement of the userÃs expertise. This encourages participants to accumulate more points and contribute to get recognition.

When an answer is votes up, the user gains 10 reputations and 5 points when the question is voted up. When an answer is accepted the user receives 15 points and there is also negative point system, a user looses 2 reputation point when a question or an answer is voted down. This keeps the spamming in check and repeated questions and answers are avoided.

The system also encourages users to participate as the higher reputation points gain more privileges. When a user has 15 reputation points, only then they can up vote and 50 points allows users to comment. To stop harassment and spam, user requires 125 reputation points to vote down and it costs the user 1 reputation point. The incentive model is thorough and higher reputation points open more gates for users to interact and contribute and be acknowledged as the expert in their field.


\section{Quality Control}

The community thrives because of the high quality of content and it is possible by the userÃs action and moderation. Users vote up the good questions and answers and vote down the bad quality content or repeated posts. There is more than 6 million votes casted in the website and the user with enough reputations are allowed to cast 40 votes per day.

  \label{Table:tabex4}
\end{table}

The analysis of the questions and votes shows that every question receives 3.06 votes on average. One question received negative 115 votes and the highest vote received to a question is 2499. Similar analysis of answers and their votes shows that, on average an answer receives 0.99 votes and the lowest vote to an answer is negative 57 and the highest vote is 4432.

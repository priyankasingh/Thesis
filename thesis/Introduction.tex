In the beginning of World Wide Web (WWW), people created static HTML webpages to share information and opinion and the documents were linked using hyperlinks. People used emails to communicate with other people even before WWW was invented. Web 2.0 has changed how people use and interact on Internet. They moved from static webpages to share content to dynamic sharing of information and started to connect with people and objects.

Now in WWW, not only documents was linked with each other, people are also connected with each other. The WWW provided a distributed and easy to use platform for people to create content and communicate with other people from all over the world. It also makes it easier for people to share information and collaborate with each other. It's easy to form communities and share knowledge.

People are connected with each other using explicit relationship or through data by creating a personal social network.
